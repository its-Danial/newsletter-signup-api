A News letter sign up application using Mailchimp API. This application has been deployed on heroku and can be visited at [this link](https://blooming-forest-03981.herokuapp.com/)

Styling has been done using bootstrap, backend is nodejs and expressjs.

If you want to use this repository, you'll have to get your own API key from mailchimp and store it in a .env file like such

```
API_KEY=YOUR_KEY
SERVER_ID=YOUR_SERVER_ID
AUDIENCE_ID=YOUR_AUDIENCE_ID

```

If API key is made public mailchimp will terminate the access to the API.

This app can be incorporated into a bigger project to allow customers to sign up for a companies newsletter.
